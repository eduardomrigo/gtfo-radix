# gtfo-radix

## Description

The "gtfo-radix" extension is designed to streamline your development process by removing unwanted import suggestions from `@radix-ui` when `shadcnui` is active. This extension ensures that only relevant import suggestions are presented, enhancing your coding efficiency and avoiding unnecessary distractions.

## Features

- **Filtered Import Suggestions**: Automatically filters out suggestions from `@radix-ui` when `shadcnui` is detected in your project, allowing only relevant imports to be suggested.
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with TypeScript and JavaScript files to provide a cleaner and more focused development experience.


> Tip: Consider adding a short animation or a series of screenshots to demonstrate how the extension filters suggestions effectively.

- **VSCode**: Ensure you are using a recent version of Visual Studio Code.
- **ShadCN**: The extension relies on the presence of `shadcnui` in your project to function correctly.
